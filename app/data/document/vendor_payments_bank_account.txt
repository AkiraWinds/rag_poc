Vendor Payments & Bank Account Management

Section 1: Overview

The platform enables freelancers and small businesses to manage vendor payments efficiently.
Vendor payments are executed using a connected bank account that is configured within the user’s account.
To ensure accurate and timely payments, users must keep their banking information up to date.

Section 2: Vendor Payment Flow

When a vendor payment is created, the system automatically uses the primary bank account on file.
Payments can be scheduled, reviewed, and tracked from the Payments dashboard.
Completed payments are not affected by future changes to bank account settings.

Section 3: Managing Bank Accounts for Vendor Payments

Each account can have one primary bank account assigned for vendor payments.
This bank account is used as the default source for all outgoing vendor payments.
Users may add multiple bank accounts, but only one can be marked as the primary account.

Section 4: How to Change the Bank Account Used for Vendor Payments

To change the bank account used for vendor payments, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Settings page from the main navigation menu.
2. Select Payments.
3. Open the Bank Accounts section.
4. Choose the bank account you want to use for vendor payments.
5. Click Set as Primary Account.
6. Confirm the change.

Once confirmed, all future vendor payments will be processed using the newly selected bank account.
Payments that have already been completed or are currently in progress will not be affected.

Section 5: Important Notes

The new bank account must be verified before it can be set as the primary account.
For security reasons, users may be asked to re-authenticate when changing banking information.
If a payment fails after changing bank accounts, users should check the verification status of the new account.
